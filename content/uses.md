I really make sure to take my time before settling with something, I would literally spend hours or even days researching for the best of this or that before truly settling on one. Because I don't frequently change my things, I want the best for the job before I stick to one.

This page will serve as a living document and a place to see all of the things I've researched before so I don't have to spent a lot of time to redo my research again and just refer back to here. I also love to collect and track my stuffs so this will also act as my stuff's track record with its own history for my personal reminder as well.

## Desktop Applications

### Code & Text Editor

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

This is my code editor for almost all the projects I do. I've been using this since late 2017 to early 2018, right after I've finished my first semester as a CS student. Although it is quite heavy, it's perfect for any small to big projects, especially if you tend to change languages and workflows quite frequently.

- [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

This is my alternative text editor for a quick and easy edit to a single file, something that only needs minor editing and not much time to spend on.

### Browser

I don't think this is quite important, but I'll still include it since I've spent some time researching this as well.

- [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/)

No question, best browser for Front-end Developers. If you play a lot with CSS styling like flex and grid, this is the perfect browser for you, especially if you write pure handwritten CSS from scratch.

- [Chromium based Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge)

Although FFDE is great for developing, you should also debug it in other browsers since CSS code won't be applied the same on every browser, let alone their versions. Chromium Edge exceeds my expectations, it seems to perform better and less resource intensive than other chromium based browsers. We don't need to install it either since it comes with Windows 10 now, so less setup to do.

### Terminal

It's just plain built-in command prompt from Windows. I've tried the beta version of the new Windows Terminal and I'm not a big fan of it. WSL and SSH works just fine in cmd, plus it works as an integrated terminal for VS Code too so I don't really have any reason to use other terminal. I've modified the fonts to use Fira Code so it looks a bit nicer and more accustomed to my workflow.

### Fonts

- [Fira Code](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code) - main monospaced font
- [Inconsolata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata) - alternative monospaced font
- [Karla](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Karla) - main headings font
- [Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik) - main default font

## Desktop Workstation

### Monitor

- `2012-07` | Lenovo L2062wA

20-inch secondary monitor. Repurposed from the old 2012 setup which still uses VGA cable, thankfully my graphics card is pretty outdated too so it still supports VGA connection.

- `2020-01` | Dell Ultrathin S2419HM

24-inch main monitor.

### Keyboard

- `2018-02` | [Corsair K95 RGB PLATINUM Mechanical Gaming Keyboard (Black, Brown Switch)](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/k95rgbplatinum)

- `2018-02` | [Corsair MM300 Extended Anti-Fray Cloth Gaming Mouse Pad](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/mm300)

### Mouse

- `2015-02` | Logitech G502 Proteus Core

### Speaker

- `2012-07` | [Altec Lansing VS4621](https://www.amazon.com/Altec-Lansing-VS4621-Computer-Speaker/dp/B0038W0NEU)

It's not in their website anymore, tbf its a pretty old product so I think they're not producing more of it either. But, at the time of writing, it still held up really nicely and I have no complaints with it. Gives a clear surround sound feel and good bass. It's at least way better than the built-in monitor speakers or other budget speakers.

### Webcam

- `2020-01` | Logitech C922 Pro Stream Webcam

I might've foreseen this and saved myself big time, but I really can't imagine what would happen if I didn't bought this webcam early 2020. I didn't have any webcam for my desktop setup for years and I've always wanted this ever since 2015, even though I don't really have any use for it at that time. I'm not even sure what I'll do after I bought this too, I just felt like I needed to complete my desktop setup since I've neglected it for quite some time after I started college. But, now that I'm commuting every day to campus and back home, I did my research here and this is the best I could get for my situation. I wanted to have Windows Hello so badly on my PC, but it seems unnecessary to get [Logitech BRIO 4K](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/brio) just for that, especially when I won't use it for its full potential. Though, anyone with an unlimited budget or just need to have it for conferences should definitely get that over C922. An even better option is to use an actual camera linked to your PC, but I feel that's pretty excessive if you're not a content creator.

### Drawing Tablet

- `2018-12` | [One by Wacom CTL-472/K0-CX](https://www.newegg.com/red-wacom-ctl-472/p/172-008A-00003)

### Desk Lamp

## Laptop Workstation

### Laptop

- `2011-XX` | MacBook Pro 15
- `2014-09` | [HP Envy 15-k024tx](https://support.hp.com/id-en/document/c04337678)
- `2018-02` | [Dell XPS 13 9370](https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-sg/product-support/product/xps-13-9370-laptop/overview)

I can't say much about this, by far the best laptop I can recommend to have for casual users. Excellent battery life, compact and lightweight form factor, powerful internals. You can always plug in an e-GPU at home for any gaming or GPU intensive usage since you shouldn't be playing on the go or at work either right.

### Charger Adapter

- `2018-04` | AUKEY 56.5W PA-Y10 - Unconventional shape and size, doesn't fit well with other plugs
- `2018-10` | AUKEY 74.5W PA-Y13 - Too heavy and bulky, inconvenient to carry around and use
- `2019-08` | BASEUS 60W CCFSG - Doesn't perform well when all plugs are used, and quite big
- `2019-09` | [SlimQ 65W Adapter](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/slimq-world-s-smallest-65w-gan-adapter#/) ~1.5 months to arrive

Truly a little giant. It charges my laptop at its optimal 45W and could still fast-charge my phone in that compact and lightweight design.

### USB-C Adapter

- `2018-10` | [AUKEY USB-C Hub CB-C17](https://shopee.co.id/product/25309502/505042130)

Main dongle for wireless mouse and USB-A file transfers. I haven't been disappointed in Aukey products before, and the same thing goes for this USB-C Hub with its ethernet port. Good build quality and lightweight.

- `2018-05` | [Dodocool USB-C Hub DC30](https://www.dodocool.com/p-dc30gy.html)

Secondary dongle with more complete package for an HDMI output and SD card readers. Quite heavy and big so I don't always take it on the go.

### Wireless Mouse

- `2018-10` | [Logitech Silent Plus M331](https://www.tokopedia.com/logitech/logitech-m331-silent-mouse-wireless-black)

A nice and lightweight mouse to carry and use. Its small but comfortable to the touch and provides a really nice and muffled sound with a tactile feel when pressed, it's amazing.

- `2018-05` | [Anker PowerCore Speed 20000mAh A1278H11](https://www.anker.com/products/variant/PowerCore-Speed-20000mAh-*Upgraded/A1278011)

### Wireless Headsets

- `2018-04` | Jaybird X3 - Wired connection between the two earbuds really hinders the neck movement
- `2019-05` | ~~Samsung Galaxy Buds~~ - Lost the charging case in the train ðŸ˜¢
- `2020-03` | [Samsung Galaxy Buds+](https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/galaxy-buds-plus/)

Truly wireless is really the way to go. I've tried a lot of wireless earbuds from Jaybird X3 all the way to Sony WF-1000XM3, and Galaxy Buds compatibility with Samsung's phone is just so seamless, it's way too convenient. It fits my ear so well too, lightweight, hard to budge out, quite reasonable battery life for one whole day of use, and lastly the case is a perfect fit for the small pocket in my jeans, the one inside the big pocket on your right thigh, and it's the only one that's small but large enough to fit without slipping out or hinder your leg movement.
