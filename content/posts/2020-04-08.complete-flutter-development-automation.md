I'm sure most of you developers have at least seen this logo before, or are even currently using it right now. It's the newest cool kid in the block of course! Well, it's not really that new anymore but it's still relatively young and in par with the current next-gens like NativeScript, React Native, and Progressive Web Apps. Compared to our old-school veterans like plain Java Android, Swift, and Kotlin perhaps? They are the successors to our modern world.

## What even is Flutter

For those who've never heard of this, Flutter is Google's UI framework to develop mainly mobile applications for Android and iOS with their built-in SDK.

> Flutter is Googleâ€™s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase
> -flutter.dev

It is based on Dart language, created by Google too. You can see there's a pattern building up here. Google has made Dart easy by having a lot of similarities with existing languages like JavaScript, and Flutter is just like frameworks made with JS and Python.

## Why you shouldn't only learn Flutter

This is not to throw you away from learning Flutter, not at all. In fact, this might be another reason to learn Flutter even more.

- Big companies are still using legacy codes and it's not even an option to migrate the codebase to other languages, it'll just be a waste of money and time. Even the [government is still using COBOL from 1959](https://youtu.be/7d7-etf-wNI)
- JavaScript developers have had a lot of mutations with JS now being able to work as Desktop Application with Electron, and Mobile Application with Native frameworks like React Native, NativeScript, Ionic, Cordova, etc. Most small startups don't really have the resources to invest in a diverse team.

So if your goal is to work in a multi-million dollar companies, or just any big companies with legacy codes, then Flutter may not be your first choice, but it should still be in your toolset.

Either that, or the startup you're aiming for is using one technology (usually just JavaScript) to develop all of their applications, from Desktop to Web to Mobile to Tablets, and etc.

## Why you should start using Flutter

1. Built-in and pre-made custom widgets
2. Mild learning curve
3. Excellent, top-tier documentation
4. Fast-growing community
5. No messing with XML files
6. Native performance with no bridge
7. Supports both strong and weak typing
8. Hot reload functionality
9. Write once for all platforms

I really can't think of any other reasons why we shouldn't start using Flutter to develop any **future** mobile apps. It is, in fact, the fastest and hottest rising stack in the current mobile development world.

If you're still not convinced yet... excluding Swift, which is slowly going down on the trend, Flutter is the highest on the chart! It is on its way to beat native languages like Swift, Java, and Kotlin.

Please keep in mind that this will only apply if you are actually developing new apps either now or in the future. It's not really encouraged to migrate existing codebase, especially huge ones, to Flutter.

## Time-driven development

This is what I'll be basing on for this post. Advokasimu, which is the app my team and I are currently working for this 2020 course of PPL. We have been researching for a lot of time before we started and we found our best engine for this project.

Remember what I said before about having a pattern building up here. Well, here's another Google's child, which is Firebase.

![Firebase logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Firebase_Logo.svg)

Firebase is the best engine for Flutter, it feels like it's specially built for it. Well, I guess it is since both are made by Google. But! There are other reasons of course.

I'll start of by saying there's no reason for you to not use Firebase with Flutter, except if you're concerned with using Google products, in which case picking Flutter should also be in your concern too.

Sadly, Firebase can't be self-hosted, but then again, the benefits that comes with it is spectacular. It is scalable too in a sense that, when you need more performance, bandwidth, storage, or anything in that matter, you can just pay for it. Just think of it as a substitute to the electricity cost and other things to set up and run your own server in exchange for time, energy, and convenience.

Of course, we'll be going through what's best for this project since it is a time-driven development.

1. Zero-config development

    One of the biggest bottleneck of developing an application is focusing on infrastructure management, and when your constrain is time, this is something that you shouldn't think too much about.

    Firebase provides a lot of functionalities straight out-of-the-box. Just a couple of clicks to set up a project, download its pre-made config file, and you're set to go! Everything is handled by Firebase and you can start developing instantly.

2. Multiple available functionalities

    There are dozens of functionalities to choose from. It has serverless architecture to create scalable apps, real-time and production-ready databases, simple authentication, cloud storage, unlimited app analytics, etc.

    All of which you need to set up manually in other DBMS, or just a pain to use. Which is not the case here with Firebase.

3. Excellent APIs

    Straight-forward, plain and simple APIs to use that integrates perfectly with Flutter's data fetching and handling.

## Continuous Integration

Flutter, well... all of static typed language is somewhat a double-edged sword. It would be an excellent investment for the future of the codebase, but yet again, when time is a constraint, it can be a problem for yourself too.

Thankfully, we have automation in our side! Flutter's linter is so verbose and exact, it would tell us exactly what went wrong and what is expected. We will set it up to check every time we pushed our code.

Like any other projects, having to wait and download the same exact stuff again and again is tedious and time-wasting. So, I built my own image and pushed it to the docker hub.

<pre class="aqua-code" data-language="yaml" data-title=".gitlab-ci.yml">
image: ignatiusmb/ppl2020-flutter:latest
</pre>

This is so that I'll have a pre-cached image to pull from and avoid having to wait to download and setup Flutter or NodeJS or other stuffs. You can absolutely use this exact image too.

Then, all you have to do is specify your stages according to your needs, and have one for linting like this.

<pre class="aqua-code" data-language="yaml" data-title=".gitlab-ci.yml">
lint:codebase:
  stage: lint
  script:
    - flutter analyze
</pre>

That's it! Now every time you commit and pushed new code to the repository, it will automatically run as a new job in the pipelines and lint the newly added code.

That's not the only fun part though, we're going to add automated tests and coverage too. Just add this code in another stage cycle.

<pre class="aqua-code" data-language="yaml" data-title=".gitlab-ci.yml">
test:coverage:
  stage: test
  script:
    - flutter test --machine > tests.output
    - flutter test --coverage
  coverage: '/lines......: \d+\.\d+\%/'
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - $CI_PROJECT_DIR/coverage
    expire_in: 2 days
</pre>

What's happening is that we're running the tests and saving the coverage as an artifact to pass on to the next stage, which they need to create the analysis.

<pre class="aqua-code" data-language="yaml" data-title=".gitlab-ci.yml">
analysis:quality:
  image: ignatiusmb/sonarscanner-flutter:1.0.0
  stage: analysis
  dependencies:
    - test:coverage
  before_script:
    - flutter pub get
    - rm -f analysis_options.yaml
  script:
    - sonar-scanner
      -Dsonar.login=$SONARQUBE_TOKEN
      -Dsonar.projectKey=$SONARQUBE_PROJECT_KEY
      -Dsonar.branch.name=$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME

analysis:coverage:
  stage: analysis
  dependencies:
    - test:coverage
  script:
    - lcov --list coverage/lcov.info
    - genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - $CI_PROJECT_DIR/coverage/
    expire_in: 10 days
</pre>

What's happening above is that we're using the artifacts previously as a dependency for out analysis stage to create our coverage and SonarQube analysis. This is something new my school has set up for us to hopefully prevent any bias in grading our code quality.

`analysis:quality` is to send out the command to run the analysis on our code, and `analysis:covergae` is to create the final lcov and html as an artifact to download. This won't happen in the previous jobs has failed.

## Continuous Delivery/Deployment

This is the part where we're going to ship our products to our clients, and hopefully make out lives easier to test and check our production app too.

We're going to leverage on a platform called App Center by Microsoft to deploy our app. Thankfully, they have an cli to actually make all of this easier too using npm!

Before we continue, we're going to create a helper script so in case we want to make several different jobs for development build and production build, we won't have to write a lot the same code.

<pre class="aqua-code" data-language="yaml" data-title=".gitlab-ci.yml">
.before_deploy:
  before_script:
    - appcenter login --token $APP_CENTER_API_KEY
    - echo $GOOGLE_SERVICES | base64 -di > android/app/google-services.json
</pre>

A slight workaround since we're using Firebase is that the json config file shouldn't be pushed to the repository since it's a secret. So, we're using GitLab's secrets to store the file in base64 and decode it before we're running the job! It's quite simple right. We also logged in to our account in App Center using a generated token saved in the secrets too.

Then, all we have to do is extend our pre-made script, build the apk on release mode, and use appcenter cli to distribute it.

<pre class="aqua-code" data-language="yaml" data-title=".gitlab-ci.yml">
deploy:production:
  extends: .before_deploy
  variables:
    ENV_NAME: "production"
  stage: deploy
  only:
    - master
  tags:
    - docker
    - build
  script:
    - flutter build apk --release --build-number=1
      --build-name=$APP_NAME
    - appcenter distribute release -f build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
      --app $APP_CENTER_APP_NAME_DEV
      --group $APP_CENTER_GROUP_TARGET
  environment:
    name: production
</pre>

That's it! We have now completed our setup to fully automate flutter development using GitLab's devops specifically. All you have to is just start writing some code. Cheers!
