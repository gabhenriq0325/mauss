Hey there, I'm Ignatius Bagussuputra. All related social are available at the bottom of all page.

I'm currently an CS undergraduate at the University of Indonesia.

I'm quite a slow typer at around 65 WPM, perhaps I'm too spoiled by mobile keyboard autocomplete with type swiping and my code editor's IntelliSense.
